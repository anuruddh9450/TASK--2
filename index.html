                    <p>Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and one of the most celebrated spiritual leaders of India. 
                     He was more than just a spiritual mind; he was a prolific thinker, great orator and passionate patriot.
                     He carried on the free-thinking philosophy of his guru, Ramakrishna Paramhansa forward into a new paradigm. 
                     He worked tirelessly towards betterment of the society, in servitude of the poor and needy dedicating his all for his country.
                     He was responsible for the revival of Hindu spiritualism and established Hinduism as a revered religion on world stage.
                    His message of universal brotherhood and self-awakening remains relevant especially in the current backdrop of widespread political turmoil around the world. 
                     The young monk and his teachings have been an inspiration to many, and his words have become goals of self-improvement especially for the youth of the country.
                      For this very reason, his birthday, January 12, is celebrated as the National Youth Day in India.</p>

                        <h4>Life of Monk</h4>During the middle of 1885, Ramakrishna, who had been suffering from throat cancer, fell seriously ill.
                               In September 1885, Sri Ramakrishna was moved to Shyampukur in Culcutta, and a few months later Narendranath took a rented villa at Cossipore.
                              Here, he formed a group of young people who were ardent followers of Sri Ramakrishna and together they nursed their Guru with devoted care. 
                              On 16 August 1886, Sri Ramakrishna gave up his mortal body.
                       
                        <h4>Lecture at the World Parliament of Religions</h4> During the course of his wanderings, he came to know about the World Parliament of Religions being held in Chicago, America in 1893.
                             He was keen to attend the meeting, to represent India, Hinduism and his Guru Sri Ramakrishna’s philosophies.
                             He found assertion of his wishes while he was meditating on the rocks of Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of India.
                             Money was raised by his disciples in Madras (now Chennai) and Ajit Singh, Raja of Khetri, and Vivekananda left for Chicago on May 31, 1893 from Bombay
                             He faced insurmountable hardships on his way to Chicago, but his spirits remained as indomitable as ever.
                                    On 11 September 1893, when the time came, he took the stage and stunned everyone with his opening line <b>“My brothers and sisters of America”.</b> He received a standing ovation from the audience for the opening phrase. 
                            He went on to describe the principles of Vedanta and their spiritual significance, putting Hinduism on the map of World Religions.
                            He spent the next two and a half years in America and founded the Vedanta Society of New York in 1894.
                            He also travelled to the United Kingdom to preach the tenets of the Vedanta and Hindu Spiritualism to the western world.
